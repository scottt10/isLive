      <description>Overview: CozyHosting is an Linux Easy Machine that features a Spring Boot application. The Actuator endpoint has access to get mappings and sessions. A user&amp;rsquo;s session cookie can be found by enumerating the endpoint, which grants authenticated access to the main dashboard. The program is susceptible to command injection, which can be used to take control of the remote computer and obtain a reverse shell. By counting the JAR files in the application, hardcoded login credentials are found and utilized to access the local database.</description>
